## Scope and Objectives
DKA aims to develop a comprehensive simulation model for the committee, with no defined parameters based on the dataset, to allow the committee to continuously monitor the performance of the RNT without adjusting the model. In addition to the model, we aim to provide a development plan that would promote soccer in Rarita and boost the economy in the surrounding region. 

To further assist the committee to monitor and review the team performance, we have provided several frameworks to minimize the human bias in decision making. We have also provided a review schedule and metrics that the committee should assess on a timely basis. 
DKA has recognizes the limited dataset that the committee has provided us and have highlighted the assumptions and relevant risk associated within this report.
